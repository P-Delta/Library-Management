# Requirements Definition

### **System Scope/Purpose**

Client is requesting for an application that functions as a library management tool meant to be used by guest users, library members, and workers. For guest 
users, the application will appear as a normal application that lets them open various windows such as to make an account with a membership as well as search for 
books using the library's database. More windows will open up once they make library account that will allow them to track their history, fees, and wishlist 
books for future reservations while they also have membership. For library workers the application should appear differently with a dashboard that allows them to 
view a list as well as manage all of all their users, books, loans, overdue fees. Will be a web application so that all guest users, members, and library workers 
have easy accessibility to all library capabilites.

### **Waterfall model**

We are using waterfall model as the core/primary software process.
This plan driven approach will use feedback from one phase into another helping to ensure good coding habits, clear version control, and additional safety.

## 1. Requirements Elicitation & Analysis

Guest User: (Any user who visits the site who wishes to view book selection or make an account)
- Must be able to make an account associated with the web app in seperate window as well as sign up for an active membership associated with the account
  - Account will be made with a verified email and strong password (8 characters at least with a combination of numbers and upper/lower case letters)
  - Attempts to use member capabilities like reserving a book without a membership will show a popup to activate a membership
  - Accounts made for a guest user without an active membership will be treated the same as an account holder but without the ability to reserve books for reading/loaning
  - Payment methods for membership must be verified before accepting and an auto-renew option will be asked to the user
- Must have a search window that allows users to search for books
  - Search filters will be added to sort by title, author, genre, and book availability
- Able to log in

Member User: (Any user with an account logged in to the web app)
- This function will only be usable while user has an active membership
  - Reserve books for in-person reading/loaning in a separate window
- These functions will still be usable even while user does not have an acitve membership or never made one
  - Ability to wishlist books that are unavailable that sends out a email notification when it is available
  - View current & past history records (books, loans, fees, etc.)  
- Member user can always log out of account in web app

Administrative User: (Any library worker that needs to use managment capabilites of web app)
- Must be able to login to a dashboard that can manage users and keep track of their activity, history, and fees within the system
  - Option to allow for admin user to view the web application as a regular user
  - Capabilities of managing user include (add, modify, delete, etc.) books, loans, fees, etc.
- Must be able to view a list of all registered users and their roles in the web app
  - List must mention users membership status and/or administrative status

##  2. Requirements Specification
**Functional Requirements**
> -In addition to any user specfied requirement in Requirements Elicitation & Analysis
- Must be able to store large quantities of various data (books, users, loans, return dates, etc..) likely within a database
  - Validation checks are needed for this to keep track of which books are being loaned out and which are physically available
- Must have an automatic system that sends out email notification reminders to library members for active and overdue book loans
  - Also must be used to send out reminders to member users who don't have an active membership to renew their membership

- Footer section of every window in web app must have references/links to all social media platforms/accounts related to the web app

- Application must support multiple windows being opened and used by end-users as well as the ability to drag and rearrange windows
  
- Smooth navigation between all windows while being opened up or while having more than one open at once

- Shortcuts, various fonts, resizable windows, and various color schemes must be included as features

**Non-Functional Requirements**
- *Performance*
  - Home page loads ≤ 3s  (disregarding backend build times)
  - Search results ≤ 2s

- *Scalability*
  - Supports ≥ 9 concurrent users for MVP

- *Availability & Reliability*
  - Cross platform (Must work with various OS’s)
  - 99.9% uptime accessibility during library hours (9:00 AM - 5:00 PM)
  - Data persistance after crashes

- *Security*
  - Passwords hashed  
  - Role-based privileges

- *Usability*
  - Responsive, accessible UI across devices

- *Maintainability*
  - Modular codebase  
  - Updated documentation per release

- *Portability*
  - Works on all modern browsers

**Window Requirements**

> In addition to any window requirement stated for users in Requirements Elicitation & Analysis

*Footer (included in all windows)*

4 more windows needed that can be accessed in anywhere in the web app

  1. **Home**: Landing page, Introduces and addresses goal of the web app

  2. **About**: Chronological list of educational qualifications, professional/technical skills, recognition, and work experience gained by each team member

  3. **Credits**: Tasks/Roles assigned and completed by each team member with a headshot photograph

  4. **Contact**: Fillable form with a name, email, and phone number field that when submitted by an end- user, sends an email notification to all team members

##  3. Requirements Validation

**Objectives**

- Serves as proof of final review
- Ensure all functional, non-functional, and any user requirements are valid and hold true to their designed purpose
  - Includes guest, member, adminstrative user, all windows needed, and any other functional/non-functional requirement

**Techniques/Methods for Signoff**

- Completeness for each functional requirement will be checked to make sure it lines up with what client asked for
  - Ensure all user requirements found in the Requirements Elicitation and Analysis section lines up with the overview in the instruction document
  - Ensure all functional and non-funcationl requirements in the Requirements specification section makes sense with where they are labeled and lines up with the project requirements and guidelines of the instruction document
- Consistency checks will be made to ensure all requirements are consistent
  - Read through requirements document and make sure that any requirement does not have conflicts with each other
  - Ensure there are no confusing elements that make it hard to understand a requirement's purpose
- Realism checks will be implemented for early feasibility and realism for development
  - All functional and non-functional requirements must be feasible and testable in later stages of software development so state any that aren't before signoff
  
**Criteria**

- &#x2611; Accepted: Requirements are feasible, testable, and ready for design phase
- &#x2610; Not-Accepted: Requirements are not feasible, testable, or cannot be implemented
